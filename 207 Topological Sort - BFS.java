### Key Concept:
- **Topological Sort** is used to order nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- If we can generate a valid topological ordering of all courses, it means there is no cycle.
- If we detect a cycle during the process (i.e., we can't take all courses), we return `false`.

### Simplified BFS Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        // Step 1: Initialize graph and in-degree array
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        // Step 2: Build the graph and calculate in-degrees
        for (int[] pair : prerequisites) {
            graph.get(pair[1]).add(pair[0]);
            inDegree[pair[0]]++;  // Increase in-degree for the dependent course
        }
        
        // Step 3: Add courses with in-degree 0 to the queue
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        int completedCourses = 0;
        
        // Step 4: Process the queue (BFS)
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int course = queue.poll();
            completedCourses++;
            
            // Reduce in-degree of dependent courses
            for (int nextCourse : graph.get(course)) {
                inDegree[nextCourse]--;
                if (inDegree[nextCourse] == 0) {
                    queue.add(nextCourse);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 5: Check if all courses are completed
        return completedCourses == numCourses;
    }
}
```

### How This Works:
1. **Graph Representation**: Each course is represented as a node. If course `a` depends on course `b` (`[a, b]`), we create an edge `b -> a`.
2. **In-Degree**: In-degree tracks how many prerequisites a course has. If a course has `inDegree = 0`, it can be taken immediately.
3. **Queue Processing**:
   - Start with courses that have no prerequisites (in-degree 0).
   - As courses are completed, reduce the in-degree of dependent courses.
   - Continue until all courses are processed or a cycle is detected.

### Example:
- **Input**: `numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2]]`
- **Graph**:
  ```
  0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
  ```
- **In-Degree**:
  ```
  [0, 1, 1, 1]
  ```
- **Queue** (start): `[0]`
- **Order of Processing**: `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3` â†’ All courses are completed.

---

### Why This Is Simpler:
- No need for recursion or `visiting`/`visited` arrays.
- It uses standard BFS, which is easier to visualize and implement.
- Avoids stack overflow issues that can occur with deep recursion in DFS.

---

### Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time**: `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of courses and `E` is the number of prerequisites.
- **Space**: `O(V + E)` for the adjacency list and queue.

---

### Why This Works:
- If there's a cycle, not all courses can be added to the queue (because their in-degree never reaches 0).
- If all courses are processed (`completedCourses == numCourses`), we know there's no cycle.

This solution is efficient, straightforward, and handles all edge cases correctly.
